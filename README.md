# Uber-Trips-Project
Project Description: The aim of this project is to carryout an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an Uber trips dataset from New York to derive insights and patterns on which location and day(s) have the highest and the lowest trips or the busiest hour. New York has a highly complex transportation system coupled with a large residential populace.  We are going to be make use of the Jupyter notebook and the python libraries for data manipulation and visualization.

Accompanying the python notebook, is the attached csv file, and a Power BI visualization of the Uber pick-up locations, and the categorical purpose for which the rides are hired.
